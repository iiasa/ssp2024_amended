Subject: RE: SSP OECD GDP: dealing with missing countries and population deviation mismatch

Hi Jarmo and Jean,

 

Attached is a first draft of the database for AFG, PSE (WBG), SYR and VEN.

I used the following approach:

AFG was possible to add to our database, so should be as robust as the countries in the normal database; we are a bit higher than Jesus in 2025, but not problematically so.
PSE I have also added; part of the problem was that we use the term WBG and avoid the term Palestine; we are well aligned with Jesus in 2025.
SYR: we have WorldBank and IMF data for 2020, I used the average per capita growth rate of neighbours Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq to make the projections; we have higher levels than Jesus for 2025, but ours are much closer to the IMF and WB data for 2020 (Jesus, perhaps you included a strong negative shock between 2020 and 2025?).
VEN: we have data until 2011, but I found GDP in current prices from IMF for 2011 and 2020, and used those to approximate the 2020 GDP in constant prices (prices are a huge issue in VEN, so it is impossible to use anything else); I then used the average per capita growth rate of neighbours Bolivia, Colombia and Guyana to make the projections (Bolivia is not technically a neighbour but among the most similar to Venezuela); we are well aligned with Jesus in 2025.
I tested a bit and find that this “average of the neighbours” approach works better than including a much larger group of countries from the region, while it avoids linking the country to one particular neighbour.

Jean – if you have any issues with these projections or the assumptions, please let me know and we can talk and revise as needed.

Jarmo – please have a look how these compare to your 4 approximations and whether you find the profiles plausible.

All the best,

 

Rob

 

P.S. I know you will come back to me with the request to fill in historical years, but that looks tricky.
